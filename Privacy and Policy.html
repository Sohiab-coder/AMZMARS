        <p class="impressum-para-main">The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal
            data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with
            the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be
            collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection
            Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains
            how, and for which purpose the information is collected.</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e.,
            through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data
            against third-party access.</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR)</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">AMZMars <br>Abdullah Abdulsattar<br>Violet Block Bahria Town<br>Lahore Punjab<br>5400 Pakistan</p>

        <p class="impressum-para-main">The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or
            jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data
            (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Storage duration</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy,
            your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If
            you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
            deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
            commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons
            cease to apply.</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the
            basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to
            Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your
            end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25 (1) TTDSG.
            The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for
            the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
            Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis
            of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate
            interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is
            provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or
            other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your
            personal data may potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there. We must
            point out that in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be
            guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the security
            agencies and you as the data subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence,
            it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently
            archive your personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.
        </p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your
            express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be
            without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct
            advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR,
            YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING
            FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE
            LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF
            YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO
            PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS,
            RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL
            ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
            ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES
            OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH
            SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT
            ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a
            complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their
            domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint
            is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Right to data portability</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process
            on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a
            commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another
            controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content,
            such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an
            SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address
            line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the
            browser line.</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read
            by third parties.</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at
            any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the
            purpose of the processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated.
            If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
            hesitate to contact us at any time.</p>

        <p class="impressum-para-main">You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the
            processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand

            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="impressum-para-main">If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful

            </li>

                    exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the

                    and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with
            the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or
            defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for
            important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>

            with the mandatory information to be provided in our Site Notice to send us promotional and information
            material that we have not expressly requested. The operators of this website and its pages reserve the

        <h3 class="commen-h3">Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all
            resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing
            your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is
            related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In
            all other cases, the data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of
            inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has
            been obtained.</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request
            us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after

            remain unaffected.</p>
        <h3 class="commen-h3">Communication via WhatsApp</h3>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">For communication with our customers and other third parties, one of the services
            we use is the instant messaging service WhatsApp. The provider is WhatsApp Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal
            Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">The communication is encrypted end-to-end (peer-to-peer), which prevents WhatsApp
            or other third parties from gaining access to the communication content. However, WhatsApp does gain access
            to metadata created during the communication process (for example, sender, recipient, and time). We would
            also like to point out that WhatsApp has stated that it shares personal data of its users with its
            U.S.-based parent company Facebook. Further details on data processing can be found in the WhatsApp privacy

            data (e.g., contact and communications data, application documents, notes taken during job interviews,

            The legal grounds for the aforementioned are § 26 GDPR according to Law (Negotiation of an Employment
            Relationship), Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (General Contract Negotiations) and – provided you have given us your
            consent – Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any time. Within our company, your personal

            submitted will be archived on the grounds of § 26 GDPR and Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR for the purpose of implementing
            the employment relationship in our data processing system.</p>

        <p class="impressum-para-main">If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job offer or withdraw

            interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for up to 6 months from the end of the application procedure (rejection or
            withdrawal of the application). Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the physical application documents
            will be destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is
            evident that the data will be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g., due to an impending or
            pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place when the purpose for further storage no longer
            applies.</p>
        <p class="impressum-para-main">Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement (Article
            6(1)(a) GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements preclude the deletion.</p>
