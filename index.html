                        10/10!!! TOP TALENT!!! Absolutely amazing product researcher and amazon fba expert, this gig is a must-have this guy just saved me weeks of research!!! I am astonished at how good this work is and how well he understands my needs. This is the absolute best product research I’ve found on fiverr and I’ve been through many, remember that you get what you pay for and this gig is worth every dollar and because the level of detail and quality you receive in hindsight this gig pays for itself–with the product I received this gig will be a tax write-off and because the product that I received is so amazing this cost of this gig is meaningless! Worth every dollar! Top quality work. 10/10!!

As the nich is strong even though the pet nich is very competitive but coming with a different idea will make the product not compete with others and fight with prices. Thank you !
